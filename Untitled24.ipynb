Next, we set a common average reference, which involves computing the average signal across all electrodes at each time and subtracting it from each channel. This makes the data reference-free and often improves spatial analysis. We also show how to perform ICA to remove artifacts; in practice you would inspect components or use automated labeling (e.g., mne-icalabel) to choose which ICs to exclude (eye blink components, muscle noise, etc.).

For example, a graph low-pass filter could set $H(\\lambda)=1$ for low $\\lambda$ (smooth modes) and $H(\\lambda)=0$ for high $\\lambda$ (rapid-varying modes), thereby preserving global synchronized activity and removing local noise. A high-pass filter would do the opposite. A generic FIR graph filter can be applied by multiplying each Fourier coefficient by the desired gain: $\\chi_{\\text{out}}[\\lambda_i] = H(\\lambda_i) \\chi[\\lambda_i]$\n",
